### How to create a realm file

You can create a realm file and prepopulate it with existing data with **[realm studio](https://realm.io/products/realm-studio/)**.
Your data needs to be a csv file to create a realm with it. In realm studio go to **File >
Create Realm From > CSV**. Select your csv data and the file will be created and opened in realm studio.

For **example**: this color data will create the following realm file.

### Using a realm file (*react native*)

Now that you have generated a realm database you can use it with open. Before opening the realm database you have to **declare the database configuration object**. You can do this from realm studio by going to **File > Save model definitions >** and then selecting the language that you are using. I am using Javascript for this example so the exported file looks like this:

```javascript
exports.colors = {
  name: 'colors',
  properties: {
    name: 'string?',
    hex: 'string?'
  }
}
```

Once you know the path of the realm file from your react native app you can open it with:

```javascript
var schema = {
  name: 'colors',
  properties: {
    name: 'string?',
    hex: 'string?'
  }
}

Realm.open({schema: [schema], path: path_to_your_realm_object})
  .then(realm => {
    // ...use the realm instance here
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle the error here if something went wrong
  });
```
